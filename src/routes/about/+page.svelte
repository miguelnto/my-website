<h1>About me</h1>

<br>

<p>Hello there! I'm Miguel, a Software Engineer that is actually trying to solve real world problems. I'm very passionate about web development, mobile development, and systems programming. 
</p>
<p>When I program, I do care a lot about readability, extensibility, safety, compression-oriented design, and applying no-nonsense conventions. The kind of software I write is mainly focused in solving pratical problems.</p> 
<p>In my blog, you'll see me talking about new technologies and its applications, tutorials, tips, rants, and opinions (mostly) on technology-related topics.</p> 
<p>You can also find me in a lot of websites, take a look at the <a href="/contact">contact</a> page.</p>
